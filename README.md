# egghead.io Learn AWS Lambda from scratch

This repo contains notes from [Tomasz Lakomy](https://egghead.io/instructors/tomasz-lakomy)'s _excellent_ [aws lambda collection](https://egghead.io/playlists/learn-aws-lambda-from-scratch-d29d).

Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document. Each section contains a link to the video.

## Next Steps

[Build serverless applications with AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)](https://egghead.io/playlists/learn-aws-serverless-application-model-aws-sam-framework-from-scratch-baf9)

## Collection Summary

AWS Lambda, Serverless, FaaS - there is a lot of noise around those topics online (and for a very good reason!) and it can get confusing at times ðŸ¤¯

In this collection we're going to take a look at AWS Lambda from scratch, in order to get YOU from:

"I have no idea what a lambda function is"

to

"I know quite a bit about AWS Lambda, and I'm going to use it to solve my problems"
